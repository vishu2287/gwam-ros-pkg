#summary Writing a program to control the Guardian-WAM

= Guardian-WAM Tutorial: Writing a Guardian-WAM Control Program =

*Now that we have a understanding of controlling the WAM and BarrettHand with ROS Service calls from the previous two tutorials:*

[http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMTutorialsWAMServiceCntrl Controlling the WAM with Service Calls]

[http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMTutorialsBHANDCntrl Controlling the BarrettHand with Service Calls]

*We will use that knowledge and understanding to create our own standalone Guardian-WAM control program.*

This portion of the tutorial _*does not*_ require the Guardian-WAM to be on and running.  

== Instructions ==

On a user PC, with a network connection to the Guardian-WAM.

Enter into our user created path for ROS Packages:
{{{
cd ~/ros
}}}

You can verify that your ~/ros folder is in the ROS Package Path with
{{{
env | grep ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
}}}
You should see ~/ros somewhere in the path if this is your working ROS directory

In your ros directory (~/ros) workspace.

Create a new ROS package
{{{
roscreate-pkg gwam_tutorials

#Enter your new ROS Package
cd gwam_tutorials

#Make a folder for the source code we will write
mkdir src

#Create the c++ file that we will write to control the Guardian-WAM
#For this we will use Gedit
gedit src/gwam_control_tutorial.cpp
}}}

Copy and Paste the following source code into gwam_control_tutorial.cpp
{{{
/** Guardian-WAM Control Program Publishing Guardian Velocity  **
*** Messages and WAM / BarrettHand Service Calls.              **/

//Include our main ros directive
#include <ros/ros.h>

//Include or WAM specific services 
#include "wam_srvs/BHandFingerVel.h"
#include "wam_srvs/JointMove.h"

//Include empty messages for opening the BarrettHand Spread and Moving the WAM Home
#include "std_srvs/Empty.h"
//Including geometry twist messages to control the Guardian Base
#include "geometry_msgs/Twist.h"


int main(int argc, char** argv)

  //Initialize or ROS node 
  ros::init(argc, argv, "gwam_tutorial_node");

  //Initialize our service clients to the specified topics
  ros::ServiceClient bhand_sc_clnt = n.serviceClient<std_srvs::Empty>("bhand/close_spread");

  ros::Duration(3.0).sleep(); // The BarrettHand will close the spread and wait for 3 seconds

  // Fill in velocities to control the individual finger velocities
  fvel_srv.request.velocity[0] = 0.25;
  fvel_srv.request.velocity[1] = 0.5;
  fvel_srv.request.velocity[2] = 1.0;

  // Call the BarrettHand finger velocity service
  bhand_fvel_clnt.call(fvel_srv);
  
  ros::Duration(5.0).sleep(); // The BarrettHand will move the fingers at the velocity specified and wait 3 seconds

  // We must first resize our joint vector to reflect our 7-DOF WAM
  jmove_srv.request.joints.resize(7);

  // We can now give joint positions in radians to each joint (Radians)
  jmove_srv.request.joints[0] = 0;

  // Call the WAM joint move service to reflect the desired joint positions
  wam_jmove_clnt.call(jmove_srv);

  ros::Duration(8.0).sleep(); // The WAM will move to the commanded joint position and wait for 3 seconds
  
  //Lastly we will call the WAM go_home service to send the WAM to its home position.
  wam_home_clnt.call(go_home);

  ros::Duration(3.0).sleep(); // The WAM will go to its zeroed joint positions in order to avoid collisions with the WAM and gently set itself back home

  /* Guardian Base Control Portion */  

  // Initialize our publisher to publish on the guardian_node/command topic

Save and close the file.

 
Now that we have created our file and understand how to make service calls from our own control program.  We will learn how to compile and run the program.

Running this code _*REQUIRES*_ a 7-DOF WAM and !BarrettHand 

Edit the manifest.xml in order for our program to retrieve the necessary dependencies.

Please make your manifest.xml replicate the file below
{{{
<package>
  <description brief="gwam_tutorials">

  <depend package="std_srvs"/>
  <depend package="wam_srvs"/>
  <depend package="geometry_msgs"/>
</package>
}}}
Save and Exit.

Lastly, we need to edit our CMakeLists file in order to tell the compiler to create an executable from our source file.

Please make your CMakeLists.txt file replicate the file below
{{{
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.4.6)
include($ENV{ROS_ROOT}/core/rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake)

rosbuild_init()

set(EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/bin)
set(LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib)

rosbuild_add_executable(gwam_control_tutorial src/gwam_control_tutorial.cpp)
}}}

Save and Exit.

We are now ready to compile our program
{{{
rosmake
