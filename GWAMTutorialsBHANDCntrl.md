# Guardian-WAM Tutorial: Controlling the BarrettHand with ROS Service Calls #

**The following tutorial will further understanding of the ROS Services exposed by the wam\_node and allow us to control the BarrettHand with Joint Position and Velocity Commands.**

**Please bring up the entire Guardian-WAM System before continuing with this tutorial**

> - Turn on the Guardian-WAM Master Power, WAM power, start the Guardian PC, and reset the power to the motor controller.

> - Once the Guardian system is online, please SSH into the WAM PC and launch the wam\_node

```
ssh robot@WAM
#password: WAM

roslaunch wam_bringup wam_guardian.launch
```

Your system should now be initialized and running, please continue with the tutorial.

## Instructions ##

In a terminal:
```
#First verify that your ROS_MASTER_URI is set to the guardian-wam
env | grep ROS_MASTER_URI

#if your ROS_MASTER_URI does not point to http://guardian-wam:11311
export ROS_MASTER_URI = http://guardian-wam:11311
#or edit your ROS Environment file (usually ~/ros/gwam_env.ros) to point to the guardian-wam pc
```

With the wam\_node running we can view all of the rostopics exposed for the BarrettHand
```
#The following will show all of the rosservices available
rosservice list

#This tutorial only pertains to rosservices concerning the !BarrettHand
rosservice list | grep bhand

```

We will now step through each of the BarrettHand Service Commands to understand what they do.

In a terminal please do these commands one at a time:
```
rosservice call /bhand/close_grasp
```

Similarly, we can open the grasp using
```
rosservice call /bhand/open_grasp
```

Next, we will look at opening and closing the BarrettHand Spread
```
rosservice call /bhand/close_spread
# and alternatively
rosservice call /bhand/open_spread
```

There are a number of position commands available for the BarrettHand
```
#Please allow the previous command to execute fully before entering the next command

#Grasp commands
rosservice call /bhand/grasp_pos 1.5

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_pos 0.0

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_pos 2.4

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_pos 0.0

#Spread commands
rosservice call /bhand/spread_pos 0.0

rosservice call /bhand/spread_pos 1.4

rosservice call /bhand/spread_pos 0.0

rosservice call /bhand/spread_pos 3.15

rosservice call /bhand/spread_pos 0.0

#Now we can look at single and multiple finger control
rosservice call /bhand/finger_pos [0.0,2.4,1.3]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_pos [2.4,1.3,0.0]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_pos [0.0,0.0,0.0]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_pos [0.0,0.0,2.4]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_pos [0.0,0.0,0.0]
```

Finally, lets look at the Velocity control commands for the BarrettHand
```
#Grasp Velocity Commands
rosservice call /bhand/grasp_vel 2.0

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_vel -- -2.0

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_vel 0.35

rosservice call /bhand/grasp_vel -- -3.0

#Spread Velocity Commands
rosservice call /bhand/spread_vel -- -0.5

rosservice call /bhand/spread_vel 1.5

rosservice call /bhand/spread_vel -- -0.35

rosservice call /bhand/spread_vel 3.0

#Individual and Multiple Finger Velocity Commands
rosservice call /bhand/finger_vel [0.25,0.5,1.0]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_vel [-1.0,-0.5,-0.25]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_vel [0.5,0.0,0.0]

rosservice call /bhand/finger_vel [-0.5,0.0,0.0]
```

Now that you have a full understanding of the WAM and BarrettHand ROS Services, we can learn how to write a program for robot control using these services in the next tutorial: **[Writing Your First Guardian-WAM Control Program](http://code.google.com/p/gwam-ros-pkg/wiki/GWAMTutorialsFirstGWAMProgram)**
